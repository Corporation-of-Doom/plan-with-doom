In this talk we present 2 ways in which we can add structure to SLU. First, we talk about incorporating an external parser to solve coordination if we want to extend a legacy system.
Second we pose SLU as a shallow semantic parsing problem which is also able to handle tasks like Question answering. We also talk about solving the data sparsity issue by doing transfer learning between domains and by using techniques like delexicalization and copy mechanism.', '2019-01-24 13:35:00.000-08', '2019-01-24 13:55:00.000-08', 'FCFS_E', 7, 0, 'Pacific D-F, 5 Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, CA 94111, USA

VALUES(15, 6, 'Deep Robotic Learning', 'Deep learning has been demonstrated to achieve excellent results in a range of passive perception tasks, from recognizing objects in images to recognizing human speech. However, extending the success of deep learning into domains that involve active decision making has proven challenging, because the physical world presents an entire new dimension of complexity to the machine learning problem. Machines that act intelligently in open-world environments must reason about temporal relationships, cause and effect, and the consequences of their actions, and must adapt quickly, follow human instruction, and remain safe and robust. Although the basic mathematical building blocks for such systems -- reinforcement learning and optimal control -- have been studied for decades, such techniques have been difficult to extend to real-world control settings. For example, although reinforcement learning methods have been demonstrated extensively in settings such as games, their applicability to real-world environments requires new and fundamental innovations: not only does the sample complexity of such methods need to be reduced by orders of magnitude, but we must also study generalization, stability, and robustness. In this talk, I will discuss how deep learning and reinforcement learning methods can be extended to enable real-world robotic control, with an emphasis on techniques that generalize to situations, objects, and tasks. I will discuss how model-based reinforcement learning can enable sample-efficient control, how model-free reinforcement learning can be made efficient, robust, and reliable, and how meta-learning can enable robotic systems to adapt quickly to new tasks and new situations.

We study the application of machine learning to predict which instances are likely to give rise to maximal expert disagreement. As necessitated by this, we develop predictors on datasets with noisy and scarce labels. Our central methodological finding is that direct prediction of a scalar uncertainty score performs better than the two-step process of (i) training a classifier (ii) using the classifier outputs to derive an uncertainty score. This is seen in both a synthetic setting whose parameters we can control, and a paradigmatic healthcare application involving multiple labels by medical domain experts. We evaluate these direct uncertainty models on a gold standard adjudicated set, where they accurately predict when an individual expert will disagree with an unknown ground truth. We explore the consequences for using these predictors to identify the need for a medical second opinion and a machine learning data curation application.

This year, Social Good is an overarching theme of The Web Conference. We believe that strengthening the connection between the healthcare and the web research communities, with a dedicated one-day event called The Web of Health, will advance the use of the Web for Social Good in a unique manner.

The goal of the Web of Health event is to exchange research paradigms among participants from different fields, ranging from ML and AI, to general computer science, to medicine and public health. The event program will include keynotes and invited talks, a discussion panel, as well as a poster reception.', '2019-05-15 10:30:00.000-08', '2019-05-15 18:30:00.000-08', 'FCFS_E', 10, 0, '5 Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, CA 94111, USA', 'https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hyatt+Regency+San+Francisco/@37.7942169,-122.397855,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x80858066b28006cb:0xb825fcec1d68f03b!4m7!3m6!1s0x808580614d1f605f:0x84660c500c409d2b!5m1!1s2018-11-19!8m2!3d37.7942169!4d-122.3956663', NULL, 'https://www2019.thewebconf.org/event-web-of-health');

VALUES(29, 8, 'The Future of the Open Web', 'In 2000, Professor Lawrence Lessig explained in an essay entitled Code is Law that the Web poses a question about the relationship between software and our values. As people create software, they are also making a decision about fundamental issues like freedom and privacy. Nearly two decades later, in a world woven together by the Web, this conversation is as relevant as ever. The Web has tremendous growth thanks to some of the technical and social decisions that were made in the Web’s formation. Many of these decisions reflect public, cooperative principles—an Open Web—rather than a network that is exclusive, walled, private, and proprietary. However, many questions about the governance and state of the Web have shifted or remained unanswered over time.

This day will be a discussion of the future of the Open Web and focus on “openness” in three dimensions as they relate to the Web: open-source software, open science, and open platforms. The discussions will include perspectives from policy makers, academics, activists, and practitioners. Although policy questions will play a prominent role in this debate, the day will appeal to a larger audience, including anyone who has a stake in the Web. Sessions will include an introduction to the pending questions in each focus area, a conversation among invited experts who bring differing perspectives on Web policy, and a final keynote to tie these conversations together into a thesis about the future of the Open Web. Together, these sessions will ask what the future of the Web should say about our values, what our values should say about the future of the Web, and how our hopes for an ideal Web of the future might pan out in practice.', '2019-05-16 09:30:00.000-08', '2019-05-16 15:30:00.000-08', 'FFA', NULL, 0, '5 Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, CA 94111, USA', 'https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hyatt+Regency+San+Francisco/@37.7942169,-122.397855,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x80858066b28006cb:0xb825fcec1d68f03b!4m7!3m6!1s0x808580614d1f605f:0x84660c500c409d2b!5m1!1s2018-11-19!8m2!3d37.7942169!4d-122.3956663', NULL, 'https://www2019.thewebconf.org/event-future-open-web');
